<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Trim the values in getHTMLFormDescription()
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> Dynamic forms whose "options" depend on particular values
    e.g. wormbase.org and the choice of "species".
  <dd>
       Keep different sets of descriptions around and determine
       which  to use based on the specification of the value that triggers the changes.

      
  <dt> HTMLImageElements
  <dd> Allow only one to be used.
      But want to be able to specify which one by just detecting
      the name in the argument list, e.g.
      for martview,  we have _new_new, stage_start and stage_filter.
      We would like to be able to just say
      stage_filter = TRUE and to have stage_filter.x and
      stage_filter.y be included in the form post.
  
 
  <dt> MultiStage forms
  <dd> E.g. Jean's example.

 
  <dt> Use make.names instead of  fixNames.
  <dd> Investigate why it is not behaving on my machines.

     
  <dt>
  <li>Generate help for the function(s) we create automatically.
  <dd>
     Create a help object if we still have the code from the Doc
     project and then serialize that (or not).


  <dt> Provide feedback about arguments when the user doesn't supply one.
  <dd>  Really want a help(myFunction) and for it to query the function.
      

  <dt> Make certain we are handling button and image elements properly.
  <dd>
      In the multi-form setup, buttons seem to be back.
      But only as submit buttons and they are ignored when creating
      the function.
      We may actually want to handle buttons generally to get the
      full form and then filter them.



</dl>

<h2>Low Priority</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Create a package as we create one or more functions.
 <dd>  We can leave this to the caller using  package.skeleton.
     But we can provide a simple implementation.

 <dt>
 <li>Add facilities for user to customize the creation of the function(s).
 Split the function creation code into pieces, separate functions
 Introduce methods to allow people to extend the creation mechanism
 rather than changing it.  We can use S4 classes (or even S3 for now)
 to allow extensibility for different form types.

<dd> Maybe this isn't very necessary since the functions are quite
    simple
    and people can write their own by mimicing ours.


 <dt>
 <li>Deal with encoding in getHTTPFormData.HTMLFileElement.
 <dd> This is part of RCurl. However, we can use the form description
     code here in RCurl for this purpose.


  <dt> Create a separate package for the run-time material.
  <dd>
     
</dl>


<h2>Done</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
      Add a reader function argument to process the result.
  <dd>
       Need support for classes HTMLParseHandlerGenerator

  
  <dt> goStat example.
  <dd>
      Get the submit element in the POST request.

  
  <dt> Referer field.
  <dd>
  
  <dt> Get the environment of the function from createFunction correct.
  <dd> Huh? We make it the global environment.
      Problem was that we changed a parameter in the newly created
       function
      after setting the environment, so the environment was also
      changed again.
  
  <dt> Names on checkbox options
  <dd>
      These are present if the HTML is well formed,
      e.g. &lt;input name type="checkbox"&gt;Some Text&lt;/input&gt;

  
  <dt>
  <li> http and local file access.
       Resolve the URI for the form by composing the relative action and the URI.
       Merging of URIs 
       move into http - use URIName like JMail
   <dd>
       Take the code from the httpClient package (or the code I put
       into the s133 project.)


  
  <dt>
  <li> Multiple forms in a single document.
  <dd>
       See
<pre>      
       h = multiFormElementHandlers()
      invisible(htmlTreeParse("test/dual.html", handlers = h))
      h$values()
</pre>
      Test this on many pages.


      
  <dt> Put a class on the generated function.
  <dd>
  

  <dt> Clean up the formElementHandler to get rid of the fields we
  don't  need (inputs and fixed)
  <dd>
     put classes on those that we can use (Done)
<br>
     Test this.

  
  <dt>
  <li> Cleanup the options in the select (and others) to avoid the names.
         option 
           "Ha" 
  <dd>
      This comes out in the deparsing of the form description.

      
  <dt>
  <li>Ensure that the validate arguments is working.
  <dd>
      <ul>
	<li> Make certain all are valid.
	    <br>
             Seems okay, but need more test.
	<li> Make sure we  have all of them.
	    <br> Checking names match.

      </ul>

  
  <dt>
  <li> default argument values with multiple values as vectors.
  <dd> e.g. several checkboxes.
   <br>
    Check that we are picking them up correctly in the
      formElementHandler and not just overwriting the previous setting.
<br>
     We are now. Test on SpeakEasy.html

  
  <dt>
  <li>Escape all quotes.
  <dd> Is this done for us in our earlier processing?
      Yes since we are now using deparse.

  
<dt>
<li>Support writing to text, storing as an R object,
   or creating a function  object directly.
<dd> writeFunction and createFunction.


  
  <dt>
  <li>Add an argument to the function to support CURL options.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>Error handling in checkFormArgs when all = TRUE
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>Put default in of "" for HTMLFileElement so that we don't need to specify it. 
  <dd>


  <dt>
  <li>
      Handle the spaces, etc. in the Content-Disposition.

  <dd>
  Send list="AC3.8\240M7\240X\240IV\240III:1000..4000"
   and not with simple spaces
   RFC 2388
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2399.html
   See 2046 and 2047

      <br>
  RCurl takes care of this for us.
      
  <dt>
  <li>   For wormbase, we only need/want to do this for the list field
   and not for the others but it is not clear how we can infer this.
   Is it because it is a text field and not a simple ? Seems to be.
    (In other words don't send Plain TEXT as Plain= TEXT
     but do send the AC3.8...... with the spaces identified as '= ')
    Sending list in quotes works for the browser, but not for us.


  <dd>

   RCurl again!
      

  <dt>
  <li>POST method of submission
  <dd>

      RCurl.

  <dt>
  <li>
   Handle the  <input type="file"> element.
    Change multipartFormQuery  in http.S in httpClient.      
  <dd>
      RCurl



  <dt>  <li>Capitalize the HTTP method (e.g. Post or Get)
  <dd>
     RCurl.
      
  <dt>
  <li>Check hidden fields.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>The handler functions need to handle multiple entries for the same form element name
e.g. .cgifields in the www.wormbase.org.
  Added code to do this but need to operate on the results differently.
  <dd>


  <dt>
  <li>Hidden fields should not be put in the formal argument list.
  <dd>


      <dt>
      <li>
Format the code to make it easier to read.
  And try to absorb as much as possible into run-time helper functions
that we can test separately from the function.
<dd>
  

  <dt>
  <li>
  The  URL is known when we compile the function so that gets 
put in as a default value for the url argument.
(I see that is there just NULL in the original default case. Now fixed
so that we have the URL from the handlers.)
It is handy to allow this be specified in the call so that we
can use redirections  to other mirror sites.
<dd>

  <dt>
  <li>
  We'll replace the entire query construction by using classes
from httpClient and its functions/methods to compose and send
the query.
<dd>
