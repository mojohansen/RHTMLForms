Description:  This package provides tools to process HTML forms and
  create R functions that can mimic a browser's interaction with the form.
  This allows S users to progammatically access data that is available 
  via an HTML form, avoiding the manual interaction and the need to 
  manage the data from the browser to R via files.  Instead, the 
  data from the form processing is immediately available in R.
  This does not currently deal with dynamic forms, and basically does not handle
  JavaScript in a form.
Note: The original code is quite old, but was never released. It uses XML handler functions
  where XPath queries to fetch the form elements might be easier.
  Some of the examples are out of date and the Web forms no longer exist or are quite
  different. The concepts remain as relevant now. The most recent example is in
  the help page for createFunction.
