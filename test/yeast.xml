http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/SGD/seqTools for Yeast has 3 forms on the page.
One is a simple text area for doing a quick search.
This is at the top of the page, in the header.

The second form object has a submit button above a paragraph of text
and the remainder of the form is the meat of the page.

The third form is merely a way to make suggestions
to the designers of the page and is a form that is
activated by link with a Javascript action.

So the form in which we are interested is the middle one on the page
but which appears as the third in the list of forms returned
by <s:func>getHTMLFormDescription</s:func>.
(The reason for this ostensibly strange ordering is that
this 3rd form is, in fact, nested within the second form.)
This is made more complex by the fact that there is a single
form, but it is visually divided into three separate 
blocks that are alternative input modes.
In the browser, the "user" is directed to use one
of the boxes (via the large red OR strings) .
