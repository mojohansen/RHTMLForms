<h1>The RHTMLForms Package</h1>
<p align=right><a href="RHTMLForms_0.5-1.tar.gz">RHTMLForms_0.5-1.tar.gz</a> (30 September 2011)</p>

<p>
This package allows us to read HTML documents and obtain a description
of each of the forms it contains, along with the different elements
and hidden fields. We can then programmatically generate
an R function that allows us or others to treat the
form as if it were an R function.
</p>

<p>
The basic steps are
<pre class="rcode">
library(RHTMLForms)
forms = getHTMLFormDescription("http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt")
fun = createFunction(forms[[1]])
o = fun(search_value = "dog")
</pre>
</p>

<p> The package provides functionality to obtain descriptions of HTML
forms and their elements.  It also provides run-time functionality for
invoking the form, such as validating the arguments.  </p>
